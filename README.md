PROJECT OVERVIEW:

This project is a personal portfolio website designed to showcase my skills and projects as a front-end developer. It is a multi-page static site built from the ground up to be a production-ready example of my abilities in planning, building, and deploying a modern web application.


The development process for this project was guided by a structured, four-part methodology:

Planning & Organization: Outlined a clear site purpose and a user journey across multiple pages.

Website Development: Built the site using semantic HTML5, modern CSS, and interactive JavaScript.

Code Best Practices: Refactored the codebase for maintainability, readability, and scalability.

Hosting & Deployment: Successfully deployed the final project online using Netlify.

KEY FEAUTURES:                                        
Multipage Structure: The website is organized into a clear, navigable structure with distinct pages for Home, About, Services, and Contact.

Fully Responsive Design: The layout is designed to be fully responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience on all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.

Consistent UI/UX: A shared header and footer ensure a consistent user experience across every page.

Interactive Elements: The site includes various interactive features powered by JavaScript, such as form validation on the contact page, dynamic content loading, and a toggle navigation menu for mobile devices.

Clean Codebase: The project follows best practices for code organization, with dedicated folders for CSS, JavaScript, and other assets, making it clean and easy to maintain.
